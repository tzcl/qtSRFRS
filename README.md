# qtSRFRS

The Qt Spaced Repetition Flashcard Revision System is a software solution designed to help commit content to long term memory. The underlying concept behind the program is spaced repetition, which is a learning technique that uses increasing intervals of time between subsequent reviews of content. This maximises the spacing effect â€“ the phenomenon whereby learning is greater when studying is spread out over time. 

qtSRFRS is centered around the creation and review of decks of flashcards. As you use the program, statistics are gathered about your learning and progress which is used to automatically schedules dates for the future revision. In order to reach a target level of achievement (e.g., 90% of all material correctly recalled at a given time), the software adjusts the repetition spacing interval. Material that is hard appears more often and material that is easy less often, with difficulty defined according to ease of recall.
